# System model approach using gaussian kernels
To approach an mathematical model of an unknown system <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=S">, a pool of gaussian kernels is used. The pool has a max size of $N$ and the approach makes use of a genetic algorithm, minimizing the mean square error of the approach. For this implementation <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=N = 15">
